			-- Project diva F2nd like shader for MMD --
		MMD shader written to replicate the look of Project diva F2nd 
		Written in HLSL, requires at least shader model 3.0
			
		How to use : 
			- Load the model in PMX editor and put the Specular texture in the SPA slot.
			- Put the Curve texture in the toon slot 
			- Load the model in MMD and load this shader on it
			- Turn on subset-extract, find the nose material, load the nose.fx file on it

			
		Notes :
			- If you use, credit me. I don't care if you've got beef with me or something, credit me for the work I'e done. 
			- It was written with DDS textures in mind, so if you dont use them and find a bug with it then I won't bother fixing it, you have no reason not to use DDS
			- If there are any issues, feel free to write them in the issues page or send me a message on deviantart, twitter, or discord @ mana#3458
